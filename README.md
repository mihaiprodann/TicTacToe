# Simple TicTacToe

This is a simple TicTacToe project that helped me to understand the basics of C#.

## Features

* I used *Bunifu Framework* to create a better-looking UI.
* Players can set their nickname.
* Every new round, the players swap their places.
* There's a scoring system that shows the current score.

## Future updates
* In the future, I would like to introduce a 'Single Player' gamemode. This will help me to understand the MiniMax algorithm.
## Screenshots

* The first form is where players can choose their nicknames. All players should have a nickname.
